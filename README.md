Floating targets orbit around the player and gradually move closer until they collide with the player and therefore ending the game. Players can shoot at the targets to destory them by aiming the crosshair and tapping on the screen. When a target is destroyed, another one spawns shortly after. In the event a target spawns outside the current view of the player, location indicators flash on the bottom of the screen to guide the player towards the location of the target.
